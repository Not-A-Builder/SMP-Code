### 1. Details about the prediction function needs to be understood

a. Analysis of the prediction function (.predict) for time-series data
    
b. The use of np.exp() is for the purpose of depicting a growth/decay in the curve. For more details please follow this link: https://mathinsight.org/exponential_function

##### Solution: https://github.com/Not-A-Builder/SMP-Methodology/tree/master/fbprophet%20source%20code

### 2. Do analysis with minimum 4 separate methodologies for time series data analysis

You can find adequate relevant data on the types of Time Series Analysis and Forecasting at the link: http://www.statgraphics.com/time-series-analysis-and-forecasting

a. Analyse and document their nature
    
b. Results need to be plotted in form of comparative analysis

### 3. Document writings are to be planned in LateX platform.

Work to be done on: https://github.com/Not-A-Builder/LateX-Guides-and-Templates/blob/master/A%20LateX%20Guide/Template%20Paper/article.tex

### 1. Pseucocodic form of the algorithms.

Code not required, but pseucodic algorithmic understanding and documentation is important.

### 2. Existing mathematical literature for each model.

Find and document each of the used models.

### 3: Diagrams of each model.

Plot diagrams and plots for each of the used models.

### 4: Purpose of the models.

Why we are using Regression models for this problem.

### 5: Purpose of long-term/short-term SMP.

Documentation - mostly theory.
