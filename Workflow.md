### 4: Purpose of the models.

Why we are using Regression models for this problem.

Answer from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis :  

'''
In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors'). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.

Most commonly, regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent variables â€“ that is, the average value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are fixed. Less commonly, the focus is on a quantile, or other location parameter of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the independent variables. In all cases, a function of the independent variables called the regression function is to be estimated. 
'''

In statistical terms, regression analysis modelling takes into account the entire collection of statistical methodologies that are employed to correctly estimate the correlation among multiple variables. The primary focus is on the the relationship between the depnedent variable in a particular problem, and, usually more than one, independent variables, which are also called the 'predictors', that is, the variables that will essentially help to predict the value or the effectiveness of the dependent variables. This analysis method called 'regression' will eventually help to understand the relationship between the 'criterion' variable, which is the dependent variable and the predictors. This will consequently help to understand how changing any one, or more, independent variable value, keeping the other values fixed, will affect the final predicted value of the dependent variable.  

So what a regression analysis does, is make an estimate with respect to the conditional expectations of the dependent variable, given the value(s) of the independent variables or the predictors. In mathematical terms, the regression analysis 
actually calculates the mean, or the average value of the dependent variable keeping the independent variable(s) fixed. The primary focus is on a given quantile, or any partciular location parameter, for that matter, of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable, with repsect to the one, or more, independent variables. In most cases however, the function is what is needed to be estimated, called the regression function - the function of the independent variables.

### 2. Do analysis with minimum 4 separate methodologies for time series data analysis

You can find adequate relevant data on the types of Time Series Analysis and Forecasting at the link: http://www.statgraphics.com/time-series-analysis-and-forecasting

a. Analyse and document their nature
    
b. Results need to be plotted in form of comparative analysis
